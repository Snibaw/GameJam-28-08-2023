# GameJam-28-08-2023
We created this game called "Realities" in 24 hours for a Game Jam in a team of 3. 
The theme was "Psychadelic" and all the assets were created especially for the event. 
I was in charge of development on Unity, while the other members of the group worked on 3D models and UI. 
I'm proud of the collaborative work we did, which enabled us to improve and have fun.
